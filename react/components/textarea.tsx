/* Textarea — a multi-line field that grows with what is typed.
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   `field-sizing: content` is what the source brings and it is the whole point:
   the box follows the text instead of holding a fixed six rows and scrolling.
   `textarea.css` keeps 0.11's `min-height` as the floor and its `resize:
   vertical` grip, which the source dropped — on a published class that would
   have taken away an affordance the docs teach.

   `rows` still works, and has to be re-created rather than passed through:
   `field-sizing: content` makes the browser ignore it, so it becomes a
   `min-height` of that many line boxes plus the element's own vertical chrome.
   `--ds-textarea-chrome` is that chrome; `input-group.css` re-declares it,
   because an input-group textarea has different padding. */
