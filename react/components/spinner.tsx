   `label` is the accessible name, not decoration: a spinner is often the only
   thing on screen saying anything is happening, so it says what. 0.x carried
   the same prop. Hardcoding "Loading" is right for a page and wrong for the
   third spinner in a settings list, which is why it stays overridable. */
