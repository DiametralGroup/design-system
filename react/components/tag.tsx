/* Tag — a tinted boxed label, as opposed to Badge's bare typographic one.
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   `ds-tag` and `ds-tag--success` are both in the set `docs/streamlit.md`
   publishes for Python consumers to hand-write, so the box and that modifier
   are frozen (css-ledger §1).

   The absorption is the **tone axis completing itself**: `neutral` and
   `critical` join the four 0.11 had, so a tag can say any of the six things
   every other status surface in the system can say. The prop is renamed
   `status` -> `tone` to match `Banner`, `Alert` and `Meter`, which all took
   `tone` when they landed; `status` still works and still maps, because it is
   published API with call sites in `examples/`.

   `onRemove` is 0.11's and has no source equivalent. It stays: a tag you can
   dismiss is the whole point of a filter chip, and the source's tag cannot. */
