# Foundations

The primitives the whole system is built on — color, type, space, layout, line, motion, the
mark, icons, and imagery. All values are `--ds-*` tokens defined in
[`../css/tokens.css`](../css/tokens.css) and sourced from
[`../tokens/tokens.json`](../tokens/tokens.json); see [`../tokens/README.md`](../tokens/README.md)
for the three-tier model. Each section links to its live page in the showcase.

## Color

Three tiers: charter-canonical **brand primitives**, a **neutral UI ramp**, and the
**semantic** tokens components actually read. The brand palette is canonical for brand hues
(accent `--ds-accent` = `#FF2A00`); the muted status hues come from the source app. One accent
only — the signal red — used sparingly for the tab underline, focus, and selection.

Key tokens: `--ds-ink`, `--ds-ink-soft`, `--ds-ink-faint`, `--ds-bg`, `--ds-bg-alt`,
`--ds-surface`, `--ds-rule`, `--ds-rule-soft`, `--ds-accent`, and the status families
`--ds-success` / `--ds-warning` / `--ds-danger` / `--ds-critical` / `--ds-neutral` /
`--ds-info` (each with a `*-bg` tint).

## Typography

Two voices, one weight idea. **Ufficio Light 300** carries titles (light and large); **Geist**
carries body (quiet). Titles render via the `.ds-title` utility (`--xl` / `--lg` / `--md` /
`--sm`); structure is marked with the signature uppercase `.ds-label` / `.ds-kicker` at
`0.08em` tracking. Ufficio is license-gated — if `ufficio.css` is not imported, titles fall
back to **Geist**, the charter's other face, not to a borrowed serif.

Key tokens: `--ds-font-title`, `--ds-font-sans`, `--ds-font-mono`, `--ds-font-weight-title`, `--ds-text-2xs` …
`--ds-text-2xl`, `--ds-leading-tight`, `--ds-leading-normal`.

## Spacing

A small, fixed pixel scale lifted from the source app, applied to padding, gaps, and rhythm.
Eight steps run from a 4px hairline gap up to an 80px section break, keeping vertical and
horizontal spacing on a shared, predictable grid.

Key tokens: `--ds-space-1` (4px), `--ds-space-2` (8px), `--ds-space-3` (12px), `--ds-space-4`
(16px), `--ds-space-5` (24px), `--ds-space-6` (32px), `--ds-space-7` (40px), `--ds-space-8`
(80px).

## Utility classes

A small, capped layout vocabulary for markup that isn't already a component: flex/grid
display, alignment, gap on the spacing scale above, full width, and four text utilities.
Every class maps to an existing `--ds-*` token — no arbitrary values, no responsive
variants, no colour utilities. It exists because the docs site's HTML tab renders demos as
buildless markup with no Tailwind available; see
[`docs/absorption/utility-mapping.md`](absorption/utility-mapping.md) for the source
Tailwind-class mapping.

Classes: `.ds-flex`, `.ds-flex-col`, `.ds-flex-wrap`, `.ds-grid`, `.ds-items-start/center/
end/baseline/stretch`, `.ds-justify-start/center/between/end`, `.ds-gap-1` through
`.ds-gap-8`, `.ds-w-full`, `.ds-text-xs/sm`, `.ds-text-muted`, `.ds-text-right`.

## Layout

Centered, max-width content with a sticky application bar. Three max-widths frame the page, the
content column, and the modal; a single named breakpoint governs the responsive shift. Because
CSS variables can't drive `@media`, `--ds-bp-md` is mirrored by hard-coded media queries.

Key tokens: `--ds-maxw-page` (1440px), `--ds-maxw-content` (1180px), `--ds-maxw-modal` (860px),
`--ds-bp-md` (940px), plus elevation `--ds-z-header` / `--ds-z-overlay`.

## Borders & rules

Separation is structural, not elevated: **1px hairlines and no shadows.** A standard rule
divides regions and frames surfaces; a softer rule separates rows inside a group. Backgrounds
shift to `--ds-bg-alt` where a sunken surface is needed — never a drop shadow.

Key tokens: `--ds-rule` (`#cdced0`), `--ds-rule-soft` (`#e4e4e6`), and `--ds-ink` for the
strongest 1px boundaries (table header underline, modal/status borders).

**No radius:** every corner in the system is square, driven by the single `--ds-radius-none`
token — see [no-radius.md](no-radius.md).

## Motion

Short and functional. Two easing durations cover transitions; one entrance animation
(`ds-fadein`) is used for revealed content such as tab panes. `prefers-reduced-motion` is
respected.

Key tokens: `--ds-transition` (`.2s ease`), `--ds-transition-slow` (`.25s ease`).

## Logo

The Diametral mark is three elements: the **circle** (the space of intelligence and
complexity), the **square** (the structure that brings stability), and the **line**
(Diametral's clear positioning). In product it appears as the `.ds-wordmark`, in two lockups
chosen by `data-variant`: `horizontal` is the full name set as one path, `square` sets it inside
the symbol for avatar- and app-icon-sized placements. Both are `currentColor`, so the mark
inherits ink color and stays flat and monochrome — there is no light/dark pair to swap.

The React `<Wordmark>` emits those paths itself. Hand-written markup supplies its own SVG as
`.ds-wordmark__mark` — `assets/logo/diametral-mark.svg` is the three elements drawn as
primitives, which is what `examples/` uses and what the React binding drew before
`1.0.0-beta.3`. Either form can set a product name beside the mark with the Ufficio
`.ds-wordmark__name` and an uppercase `.ds-wordmark__sub` — pair those with the `square`
lockup, since the horizontal one already spells the word.

Key tokens: `--ds-font-title`, `--ds-font-weight-title`, `--ds-ink`, `--ds-rule`.

Live: [../examples/foundations/logo.html](../examples/foundations/logo.html)

## Iconography

Icons follow the line: thin, square-cut, monochrome strokes that sit naturally beside text and
inherit `currentColor`. They match the 1px-rule aesthetic — no fills, no rounded terminals, no
duotone — so they read as part of the same flat system rather than as decoration.

Key tokens: `currentColor` (driven by `--ds-ink` / `--ds-ink-faint`), `--ds-rule`.

## Photography

Direction is **natural macro texture** — organic and material, never tech cliché. Two registers
anchor the brand: **warm walnut wood** and **cool arctic ice / water**. Shoot close, let the
material fill the frame, and avoid renders, device mockups, and stock-tech imagery. See
[brand-and-voice.md](brand-and-voice.md) for the full direction.
