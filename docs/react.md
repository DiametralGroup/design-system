# React

Real React components live in [`react/`](../react/) and are documented on the live
[component pages](https://littlebigcode.github.io/design-system/). A live, buildless demo
is at [`examples/react.html`](../examples/react.html).

## Install

```bash
npm i @diametral/design-system react react-dom
```

```jsx
// once, at your app root
import "@diametral/design-system/css/diametral.css";

import { Button, Status, Metric, Modal } from "@diametral/design-system/react";
```

`react` / `react-dom` are **optional peer dependencies** — CSS-only and Web Component
consumers don't pull them in. `recharts` (>= 3) is a regular **dependency** since
`1.0.0-beta.8` — it installs automatically with the package, no separate `npm i recharts`
step, for the twelve charts that draw their marks with it: `LineChart` / `AreaChart` /
`BarChart` / `StackedBar` / `PieChart` / `DonutChart` / `RadarChart` / `ComboChart` /
`FunnelChart` / `ScatterChart` / `Treemap` / `WaterfallChart`.

A chart's children are still written by the consumer — `<ReferenceLine>`, a second
`<YAxis>` — and those come from `recharts` directly, so a project that also depends on
`recharts` itself resolves to whichever version npm hoists to a single copy. Two divergent
copies in one tree would put the children and `ChartContainer` on different recharts
contexts, and the plot would render empty with no error.

Four charts need none of it and stay renderable as plain markup by any binding:
`Sparkline` and `Gauge` are hand-rolled SVG, `Heatmap` and `BulletChart` are CSS grid and
divs. `1.0.0-beta.5` adds no dependency of its own — its eight charts compose the
`ChartContainer` / `ChartTooltip` / `ChartLegend` substrate beta.4 already paid for. Nor
does `1.0.0-beta.6`: its fifteen components reach for Base UI's `Avatar`, `Progress` and
`Toolbar`, all already installed.

**`1.0.0-beta.6` is the batch that turns appliers into parts.** Thirteen 0.11 components
that took an `items` array or a bag of content props — `Avatar`, `Breadcrumb`,
`DescriptionList`, `EmptyState` (now `Empty`), `PageHeader`, `Pagination`, `Progress`,
`Spinner`, `Stepper`, `Timeline`, `Toolbar`, `Kbd`, `Banner` — become composable parts, and
`Table` arrives with no incumbent at all. Every prop that disappears has a replacement or a
recipe in [`docs/migration/from-0.11.md`](migration/from-0.11.md); nothing is dropped
without one. Three of them gain behaviour rather than only shape: `Avatar` shows its
fallback only once the image has actually failed, `Progress` is Base UI's with real ARIA,
and `Toolbar` is **one** tab stop with arrow-key navigation where 0.11's flex row made every
control its own stop.

Since `1.0.0-beta.1` the React layer declares two real `dependencies`:
`@base-ui/react` and `@phosphor-icons/react`. Base UI is where the behaviour of the
absorbed components lives — focus management, dismissal, positioning, ARIA wiring — and it
is adopted deliberately ([ADR 0001](adr/0001-base-ui-as-a-substrate.md)). The
zero-dependency promise is restated rather than dropped: **CSS, tokens and Web Components
import nothing**, which is what the three surfaces that cannot afford tooling consume, and a
release-blocking `layer-purity` check keeps it a fact. A CSS-only npm consumer installs the
graph but never loads it.

Each component's **binding tier** is recorded in its
[`docs/components.md`](components.md) entry: CSS parity is guaranteed for every binding,
behaviour parity is React-only and named as such.

A handful of components go one step further and ship **no binding at all** — the stylesheet
is the entire contract, and any markup rendering its `.ds-*` classes gets the look. Each
one's React binding existed only to wrap a narrow third-party dependency, and acquiring a
dependency to re-export its behaviour is the trade ADR 0001 declines. Their docs pages
print no import line and say so, and their registry entries declare `exports: []`.

| component | since | the dependency, and what it was buying |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `resizable` | `1.0.0-beta.2` | `react-resizable-panels` — the pointer maths, keyboard resize and persisted layout |
| `message-scroller` | `1.0.0-beta.2` | `@shadcn/react` — the stick-to-bottom scroll behaviour |
| `carousel` | `1.0.0-beta.3` | `embla-carousel-react` — drag, snap points and autoplay |
| `input-otp` | `1.0.0-beta.3` | `input-otp` — the hidden-input trick that makes a row of boxes behave as one field, so paste, password managers and OS one-time-code suggestion keep working |

In each case the dependency *is* the component. What the stylesheet cannot supply is named on
the component's page, so a consumer writing their own binding knows exactly what they owe.

## How it works

The components are authored in TypeScript and compiled by `tsc` alone — no bundler, no
transform beyond JSX — so the emit under `dist/react/` is plain ES modules:

- **No build step** is needed to *consume* them — they are valid JS that any bundler
  (Vite, Next, CRA, Remix, …) imports directly.
- They render the same `.ds-*` markup as the rest of the system, so styling and theming come
  from the global stylesheet and the CSS variables — change a token, every React component
  follows.
- Full **TypeScript types** ship in [`react/index.tsx`](react/index.tsx).

They are genuine React components: typed props, `children`, event handlers, `forwardRef`
(`Button`, `Input`), controlled/uncontrolled state (`Switch`, `Tabs`, `Segmented`), and a
portaled `Modal` that closes on Escape / backdrop.

## Buildless in the browser

Because they have no build dependency, you can run them straight from a CDN with an import
map — this is exactly what the live demo does:

```html
<script type="importmap">
{ "imports": {
  "react": "https://esm.sh/react@18.3.1",
  "react-dom": "https://esm.sh/react-dom@18.3.1?external=react",
  "react-dom/client": "https://esm.sh/react-dom@18.3.1/client?external=react"
} }
</script>```

The absorbed components need their substrate mapped too — the barrel imports it, so an
import map that omits these resolves nothing:

```html
<script type="importmap">
{ "imports": {
  "@base-ui/react/": "https://esm.sh/@base-ui/react@1.6.0/?external=react,react-dom",
  "@phosphor-icons/react": "https://esm.sh/@phosphor-icons/react@2.1.10?external=react"
} }
</script>
<script type="module">
  import React from "react";
  import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
  import { Button } from "../dist/react/index.js";
  createRoot(document.getElementById("app"))
    .render(React.createElement(Button, { variant: "primary" }, "Save"));
</script>
```
