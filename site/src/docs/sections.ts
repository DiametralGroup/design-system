 * The three flat doc sections, as `[slug, name, description]` rows. Lifted out
 * of the index pages they render because the sidebar reads the same rows: one
 * list means a new page cannot appear in the grid but be missing from the nav,
 * and a renamed slug breaks in one place. A `.ts` module rather than an export
 * beside a component, so Fast Refresh keeps working on the index pages.
