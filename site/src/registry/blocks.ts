/**
 * The block registry: one row per category, each holding its numbered variants.
 *
 * Shaped like `COMPONENTS` and read by everything downstream — the `/blocks`
 * routes, the sidebar, `tests/harness.ts`, and `scripts/build-agent-index.mjs`,
 * which parses this file for `docs/agent-index.json`'s `blocks` array. One list
 * means a variant cannot have a route but no nav row, or a nav row but no file.
 *
 * A variant's source is `blocks/<category>/<name>.tsx` at the repo root, a
 * default export taking no props, published in the package (ADR 0003). The
 * description answers "when do I pick this one over its siblings".
