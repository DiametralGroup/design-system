// Visual regression gate for @diametral/ui.
//
// Deliberately a curated set, not all 72 routes. Two reasons:
//
// 1. Cost. 72 routes x 2 themes is 144 full-page baselines; at typical
//    full-page size that is tens of megabytes of PNGs in git, re-churned on
//    every intentional design change. The a11y suite is the one that covers
//    every route, because it needs no committed artefact.
// 2. Signal. These routes were picked to exercise the *visual language* rather
//    than component count: the flat 1px rules, zero radius, the eight-colour
//    tone axis, dense data display, overlay layering and chart palettes. A
//    regression in any of those shows up here; a regression that shows up only
//    on, say, /docs/aspect-ratio is not a brand regression.
//
// Add a route below when it covers a visual property nothing else does.

/* Router paths, prefixed with Vite's `base` at the bottom of this list. The
   a11y suite gets that for free — COMPONENT_ROUTES is built with routePath() in
   the harness — and this list, being hand-written, did not.

   That was not a cosmetic slip. `vite preview` serves the SPA under the same
   project subpath GitHub Pages does, so an unprefixed `page.goto("/")` lands on
   a 404 with no app on it. The dark half then failed loudly ("Theme did not
   apply"), but the LIGHT half passed: a 404 page carries no `dark` class, which
   is exactly what expectTheme() checks for light. Under --update-snapshots that
   is a suite that writes seventeen baselines of a 404 page and reports success.
   Caught in 1.0.0-beta.8, the batch that first ran this suite anywhere but a
   laptop and the one that arms tier 5. */
